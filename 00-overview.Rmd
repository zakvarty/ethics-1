## Reading summaries

There are a wide range of areas in which the use of AI has lead to harm
for an individual or a section of society. In lectures we heard of an
example of individual harm, through the advertisement of maternity
products to a woman who has miscarried. We also heard an example of
group harm, through pre-trial assessments that incorrectly predicted
that Black defendants were high risk individuals. For this assessed
question you will consider another example in which the use of AI has
caused harm.

A rhetorical precis is a short summary and analysis of a piece of
writing, which considers both the content and the delivery of the piece.
A rhetorical precis includes an accurate bibliographic reference to the
text, a list of keywords relating to the text, and a highly structured
four-sentence paragraph which serves to summarise and analyse the text.
Each sentence has a specific role:

1.  The first sentence establishes the aim or thesis or the work;
2.  The second sentence explains how this aim is addressed or outlines
    supporting arguments;
3.  The third sentence states the purpose of the work (why it is
    important);
4.  The final sentence describes the intended audience and tone of the
    writing.

An example of a rhetorical precis can be found on the [lumenlearning
website](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/englishcomp2kscopex92x2/chapter/rhetorical-precis/ "Lumen Learning Website").
Creating such summaries of a paper promotes clarity and precision both
when reading and writing. It also provides a useful aid when trying to
recall the contents of a paper long after you originally read it.

Select and read an academic article that is *not on the course reading
list* and *either}*highlights one harmful instance of AI *or* summarises
the potential harms of AI more generally. Write a rhetorical precis for
your selected paper, and submit this for assessment. (Note: using a text
from the course materials or reading list will result in a 50% reduction
in the marks awarded for this question.)
