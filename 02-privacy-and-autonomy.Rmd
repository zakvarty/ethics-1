Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book.

## Captioned figures and tables

Figures and tables *with captions* can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using `\@ref(fig:chunk-label)` and `\@ref(tab:chunk-label)`, respectively.

See Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig).

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.alt='Plot with connected points showing that vapor pressure of mercury increases exponentially as temperature increases.'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Don't miss Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(pressure, 10), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```
