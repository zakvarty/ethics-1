Data-driven decision making is now pervasive and impacts us all. Your data is used by others to make decisions about who you are, how you will behave, and what options should be made available to you. Predictive models are used to decide anything from the promotion that is offered to you by a retailer through to whether your loan application is granted by a bank.

The ways in which these predictive models can fail *mathematically* form a core part of the training for an aspiring statistician, data scientist or machine learning practitioner. In contrast, the potential for *ethical* failures in these same models is rarely covered in-depth during as part of this initial training. As a result, these ethical modes of failure are often not considered until those predictive models have been put into production and are actively causing harm.

To prevent this harm, the ethical impacts of using data to make decisions must be made core to the curriculum of both statistics and data science. This course aims to address that gap.

The course takes a practical and technical approach to identifying these ethical issues. It has a strong mathematical focus and will not not require the authoring of extended essays or moral treaties. Throughout the course, we give actionable ways in which these topics may be integrated into a data science workflow at a range of levels.

## Module Description {.unnumbered}

This module will investigate the ethical implications of the new capabilities offered by Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

Part 1 will begin by discussing the ethical use of data itself - the raw materials of data science pipelines. It will then discuss sets of principles that tech leaders and international bodies are adopting to promote ethical use of data science and artificial intelligence algorithms, including a discussion of real-world examples of failings and adverse outcomes.

Parts 2 and 3 will then revisit the issues explored in Part 1 in greater technical detail. These parts will introduce data science methodologies that provide novel solutions to ethical problems of old such as explainability, prejudice and bias.

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

On successful completion of this module, you should be able to:

1.  Recognise and accept responsibility for the societal impact of data science and machine learning technologies;
2.  Participate in the broader debate about the issues surrounding the use of data science and machine learning for prediction, decision making and knowledge generation tasks;
3.  Identify common ethical pitfalls of data science and ML algorithms via a mental "check-list" and evaluate the degree to which a given algorithm is likely to conform with ethical best practices.
4.  Formally test for common ethical pitfalls of data science and ML algorithms.
5.  Implement mitigation measures against the ethical risks posed by the use of data science and ML algorithms.
6.  Construct well-founded and evidence-based arguments with which to positively influence the actions of stakeholders and decision-makers;
7.  Use a systems perspective to holistically appraise data science projects on their ethical and societal impacts.
